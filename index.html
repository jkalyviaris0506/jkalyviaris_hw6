      <p>
        I grew up in Des Plaines, Illinois right outside of Chicago in the north
        west suburbs. I'm currently a senior at the University of Iowa studying
        Buisness Analytics and Information Systems. As much as I've loved my
        time at Iowa I'm really excited to graduate this spring and start my
        professional career. Although this is a pretty scary time I'm super
        excited to start this next chapter in my life and see what the future
        has in store for me
      </p>

        Growing up I was alway a pretty active kid, I loved being outside.
        Baseabll was huge part of my childhood and my life, I love the sport and
        it was a huge passion of mine. I was planning to play all the way
        through college, but after a few injuries I decided it was time to hang
        up the cleats and focus on my education. That was probably one of the
        hardest decsions I had to make in my life but in the end it helped shape
        me into the person I am today.
